=head1 NAME

Compress::BraceExpansion - create a human-readable compressed string suitable for shell brace expansion


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Compress::BraceExpansion version 0.1.5.  This
is a beta release.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Compress::BraceExpansion;

    # output: ab{c,d}
    print Compress::BraceExpansion->new( qw( abc abd ) )->shrink();

    # output: aabb{cc,dd}
    print Compress::BraceExpansion->new( qw( aabbcc aabbdd ) )->shrink();

    # output: aa{bb{cc,dd},eeff}
    print Compress::BraceExpansion->new( qw( aabbcc aabbdd aaeeff ) )->shrink();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shells such as bash and zsh have a feature call brace expansion.
These allow users to specify an expression to generate a series of
strings that contain similar patterns.  For example:

  $ echo a{b,c}
  ab ac

  $ echo aa{bb,xx}cc
  aabbcc aaxxcc

  $ echo a{b,x}c{d,y}e
  abcde abcye axcde axcye

  $ echo a{b,x{y,z}}c
  abc axyc axzc

This module was designed to take a list of strings with similar
patterns (e.g. the output of a shell expansion) and generate the
un-expanded expression.  Given a reasonably sized array of similar
strings, this module will generate a single compressed string that can
be comfortably parsed by a human.

The current algorithm is most efficient if groups of the input strings
start with or end with similar characters.  See BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
section for more details.


=head1 WHY?

My initial motivation to write this module was to compress the number
of characters that are necessary to display a list of server names,
e.g. to send in the subject of a text message to a pager/mobile phone.
If I start with a long list of servers that follow a standard naming
convention, e.g.:

    app-dc-srv01 app-dc-srv02 app-dc-srv03 app-dc-srv04 app-dc-srv05
    app-dc-srv06 app-dc-srv07 app-dc-srv08 app-dc-srv09 app-dc-srv10

After running through this module, they can be displayed much more
efficiently on a pager as:

    app-dc-srv{0{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},10}

The algorithm also works great for directories:

    /usr/local/{bin,etc,lib,man,sbin}


=head1 BRACE EXPANSION?

Despite the name, this module does not perform brace expansion.  If it
did, it probably should have been located in the Shell:: heirarchy.
It attempts to do the opposite which might be referred to as 'brace
compression', hence the location it in the Compress:: heirarchy.  The
strings it generates could be used in a shell, but are more likely
useful to make a (potentially) human-readable compressed string.  I
chose the name BraceExpansion since that's the common term, so
hopefully it will be more recognizable than if it were named
BraceCompression.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 8

=item C< new( ) >

Returns a reference to a new Compress::BraceExpansion object.

May be initialized with a hash of options:

    Compress::BraceExpansion->new( { strings => [ qw( abc abd ) ] } );

Or with an array ref:

    Compress::BraceExpansion->new( [ qw( abc abd ) ] );

Or with an array:

    Compress::BraceExpansion->new( qw( abc abd ) );

This is an inside-out perl class.  For more info, see "Perl Best
Practices" by Damian Conway

=back


=head1 METHODS

=over 8

=item C<shrink( )>

Perform brace compression on strings.  Returns a string that is
suitable for brace expansion by the shell.

This method has not been designed being called multiple times on the
same Compress::BraceExpansion object.  If you call shrink() more than
once on the same object, you're on your own.

=item C<enable_debug( )>

Enable various internal data structures to be printed to stdout.

=back


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The current algorithm may only generate efficient compressions when
there are similarities in the beginnings and/or endings of multiple
strings in the array.

Finding the 'most' optimized compression is a rather tricky problem.
The next generation should add weights to the tree to estimate which
compressions are more efficient.

If multiple identical strings are supplied as input, they will only be
represented once in the resulting compressed string.  For example, if
"aaa aaa aab" was supplied as input to shrink(), then the result would
simply be "aa{a,b}".

This module has reasonably fast performance to at least 1000 inputs
strings.  I've run several tests where I cut a 10k word slice from
/usr/share/dict/words and have consistently achieved around 50%
compression.  However, the output rapidly loses human readability
beyond a couple hundred characters.

Please report problems to VVu@geekfarm.org.

Patches and suggestions are welcome!
